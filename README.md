[Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/index.html) is a Mac OS utility for customizing your keyboard.

I use the following modifications on a day to day basis and find they improve my efficiency.

1. SpaceFN and VIM arrow keys
    * Holding space will trigger the FN layer and hjkl will act as arrow keys
2. Caps lock to control or escape
    * Caps lock will send control when pressed with other keys
    * It will send escape if pressed alone
3. Shift key taps to parenthesis
    * Tapping (not holding) the left shift will send a left parenthesis
    * Same as above for right shift
